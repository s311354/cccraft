## Overview

cccraft is a personal exploration of C compiler implemenatation, inspired by [chibicc](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc.git). 

> A compiler is not just about parsing code; it's a bridge between logic and machine reality.

The goal of this project is to understand compiler internals from first principles, not just to make it work, but to deeply grasp how source code is transformed into executable binaries.
